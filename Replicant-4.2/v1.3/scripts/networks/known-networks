# This is a simple file used to store the "known" wifi networks
# lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored by the parsing scripts.
# networks credentials are stored using the format:
#         <SSID>[TAB]<password>
# *DO NOT* SURROUND VALUES WITH QUOTES! store the bare naked stirngs as they are.
# if you store a funky SSID name, or an over-complicated password
# containing a [TAB], then the whole "known networks storage" will break.
# Anyway it's highly unlikely to ever meet such a network.
# Don't mess with the contents of this file, unless you feel like hacking
# and you know what you're doing. Let the scripts do the magic. And enjoy!
